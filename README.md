# Cypress-Assignment

Clone the repo and ensure that all dependencies are installed.

* To execute all the tests do : npx cypress run (without GUI) or npx cypress run --headed

* To execute a specific test do: npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/test/login.cy.js

Please ignore the first two files in the e2e folder (getting started and advanced examples)

A few tests cases have an 'x' before it, please remove the x to run the test case.
